__________________________________________________Filter-Sort-Algorithm_________________________________________________________

This algorithm works by applying a sorting filter(a piece of sorting code) to an array or list.
According to the length of your list you can set the level(level means the no of times your list will get filtered).
And ofcourse if your list is longer or is highly unordered or both you need to set higher level of filter to get it sorted perfectly
