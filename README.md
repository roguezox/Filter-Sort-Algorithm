__________________________________________________Filter-Sort-Algorithm_________________________________________________________

This algorithm works by applying a sorting filter(a piece of sorting code) to an array or list.
According to the length of your list you can set the level(level means the no of times your list will get filtered).
And ofcourse for longer lists you need to set higher level of filter to get it sorted perfectly
